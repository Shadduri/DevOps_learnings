Git  Installation
====================================================
-> verify the git installation

git --version

If no out put , there is no git installation in the system So we need to download and install.

google with git , we will get the first link https://git-scm.com/ , from here we can download appropriate version.

Installation is very simple like the all the other softwares, post to installation check again the git version

root@ip-172-31-42-215:/opt/DevOps/Git# git --version;date
git version 2.7.4
Tue Oct 30 13:08:19 UTC 2018


->After this we need to creat an account in GITHUB.

-> We need to add our github details to GIT.

root@ip-172-31-42-215:/opt/DevOps/Git# git config --global user.email "adduri.aws@gmail.com"

root@ip-172-31-42-215:/opt/DevOps/Git# git config --global user.name "Shadduri"

-> Adding a file/folder to git i.e TRACKING

From here we will start with actual git commands

So now we need to track all the files and folders from a particular directory , we need to initialize git from that directory location.

root@ip-172-31-42-215:/opt/DevOps/Git# cd /opt/DevOps/Git
root@ip-172-31-42-215:/opt/DevOps/Git# git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /opt/DevOps/Git/.git/


git init is command will initiate the git and creat an empty git repository under that location.


root@ip-172-31-42-215:/opt/DevOps/Git# ls -la
total 24
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 Oct 30 13:22 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 Oct 30 12:58 ..
drwxr-xr-x 7 root root  4096 Oct 30 13:22 .git


root@ip-172-31-42-215:/opt/Demo# git status
On branch master

Initial commit

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)



root@ip-172-31-42-215:/opt/DevOps/Git# git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	.Git_notes.swp

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)


==The diff bw above two git status results is above output did not hav anything to commit but in second result there is an untracked file is showing.



root@ip-172-31-42-215:/opt/DevOps/Git# git add Git_notes 
root@ip-172-31-42-215:/opt/DevOps/Git# git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   Git_notes


== Now I added a file to the git and see the diff in the git status output. there is file to be committed that has been added to git.

==Now lets commit this file

root@ip-172-31-42-215:/opt/DevOps/Git# git commit -m "git notes 30-Oct-2018" 
[master (root-commit) 5b7b6dd] git notes 30-Oct-2018
 1 file changed, 89 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 Git_notes


==now this file has been committed to git with a message -m and after this if see the git status we will see there is nothing to get committ.


==> Now lets add our file to a remote repository.
git push -u orign master

GIT Branching and Merging
================================================================

=> To creat a git branch

root@ip-172-31-42-215:/opt/Demo# git branch testbranch

I have created a branch with name testbrach. Now branch is created but still I am in master brnch only So to work on my new branch I need to check out to that branch first.

=> To check out to new branch

root@ip-172-31-42-215:/opt/Demo# git checkout testbranch
Switched to branch 'testbranch'

Now I switched to new testbranch

=>Now lets add one new file and check the status 

root@ip-172-31-42-215:/opt/Demo# git status
On branch testbranch
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        text1.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
root@ip-172-31-42-215:/opt/Demo# git add *.txt
root@ip-172-31-42-215:/opt/Demo# git commit -m "adding a test file to new branch called testbranch" text1.txt
[testbranch e8d86b7] adding a test file to new branch called testbranch
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 text1.txt


Now if I check on the git repository still I am unablr to see the newly created branch because I still not pushed the files to the remote repository So lets push the file to remote repository.

 * [new branch]      testbranch -> testbranch
Branch testbranch set up to track remote branch testbranch from origin.

Now if we check the remote repository we can see the two branches.

But my new file only visible in the new branch because still I did not merged my changes with master branch

root@ip-172-31-42-215:/opt/Demo# ll

root@ip-172-31-42-215:/opt/Demo#

=> Now we have to merge the chenges to master branch for this we must checkout to the master branch

root@ip-172-31-42-215:/opt/Demo# git merge testbranch
Updating a40be81..e8d86b7
Fast-forward

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    0 Oct 31 02:43 second.jsp
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    0 Oct 31 03:13 text1.txt

Now we can see the text1 file in master branch as well but we still unable to see this new file in remote repository master branh because we still not pushed the chnages to remote repo's master branch

Branch master set up to track remote branch master from origin.


=> to delete the branch

root@ip-172-31-42-215:/opt/Demo# git branch -d testbranch
Deleted branch testbranch (was e8d86b7).

Now this deleted the new branch but can visible in my remote repo because we deleted this locally So to delete in remote repo we need apply below command

root@ip-172-31-42-215:/opt/Demo# git push -u origin --delete testbranch
