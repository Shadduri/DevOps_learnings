Git  Installation
====================================================
-> verify the git installation

git --version

If no out put , there is no git installation in the system So we need to download and install.

google with git , we will get the first link https://git-scm.com/ , from here we can download appropriate version.

Installation is very simple like the all the other softwares, post to installation check again the git version

root@ip-172-31-42-215:/opt/DevOps/Git# git --version;date
git version 2.7.4
Tue Oct 30 13:08:19 UTC 2018


->After this we need to creat an account in GITHUB.

-> We need to add our github details to GIT.

root@ip-172-31-42-215:/opt/DevOps/Git# git config --global user.email "adduri.aws@gmail.com"

root@ip-172-31-42-215:/opt/DevOps/Git# git config --global user.name "Shadduri"

-> Adding a file/folder to git i.e TRACKING

From here we will start with actual git commands

So now we need to track all the files and folders from a particular directory , we need to initialize git from that directory location.

root@ip-172-31-42-215:/opt/DevOps/Git# cd /opt/DevOps/Git
root@ip-172-31-42-215:/opt/DevOps/Git# git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /opt/DevOps/Git/.git/


git init is command will initiate the git and creat an empty git repository under that location.


root@ip-172-31-42-215:/opt/DevOps/Git# ls -la
total 24
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 Oct 30 13:22 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 Oct 30 12:58 ..
drwxr-xr-x 7 root root  4096 Oct 30 13:22 .git


root@ip-172-31-42-215:/opt/Demo# git status
On branch master

Initial commit

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)



root@ip-172-31-42-215:/opt/DevOps/Git# git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	.Git_notes.swp

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)


==The diff bw above two git status results is above output did not hav anything to commit but in second result there is an untracked file is showing.



root@ip-172-31-42-215:/opt/DevOps/Git# git add Git_notes 
root@ip-172-31-42-215:/opt/DevOps/Git# git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   Git_notes


== Now I added a file to the git and see the diff in the git status output. there is file to be committed that has been added to git.

==Now lets commit this file

root@ip-172-31-42-215:/opt/DevOps/Git# git commit -m "git notes 30-Oct-2018" 
[master (root-commit) 5b7b6dd] git notes 30-Oct-2018
 1 file changed, 89 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 Git_notes


==now this file has been committed to git with a message -m and after this if see the git status we will see there is nothing to get committ.


==> Now lets add our file to a remote repository.
